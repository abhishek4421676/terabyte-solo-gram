Project Description
SoloGram is a parody social media app where you are the only user ‚Äî yet you look like a superstar with millions of fans. Fake likes, fake followers, fake DMs‚Ä¶ all real laughter.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Lonely on social media? Tired of waiting for likes? Craving celebrity status without talent, money, or paparazzi?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
SoloGram gives you the illusion of fame.

20M+ ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù (random usernames)

Over-the-top notifications like ‚ÄúBreaking: You just broke the internet!‚Äù

Stories, posts, and comments‚Ä¶ all from you to yourself.

All backend data is fake, but the dopamine is real.
